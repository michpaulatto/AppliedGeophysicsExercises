We need to install Anaconda (https://www.anaconda.com/) and use it to install Pygimli. Some of the operations in the setup are a bit advanced and are beyond the scope of this exercise. So just run the following two code cells and move on. This may take a couple of minutes so be patient. If running this Notebook on Google Colab you may get a warning that the Notebook was not authored by Google, click OK and continue."

The regularization adds a second term to the objective function that we are minimizing at the same time as we minimize the residuals.

By minimising the regularization term we favour models that have low roughness (i.e. are smoother).\n",

To choose the appropriate value of lambda we study the trade-off curve between the misfit term (the data norm) and the regularization term (the model norm). Because of its shape this trade-off curve is often called the L-curve. To generate the L-curve we would have to run multiple inversions, each with a different value of lambda and we would then plot the data norm vs. the model norm for the final model of each inversion. This would take more time than we have available for this tutorial so I have calculated the L-curve in advance for you. \n",
